### ✅ **1. Prerequisites on Your Local Machine**

Make sure you have these installed:

* **Node.js v20+** — [Download from nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* **PostgreSQL v16** — [Install from postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* **npm** — Comes with Node.js
* (Optional) **Nix** — Only if you want to mimic the Replit environment exactly

### ✅ **2. Clone or Download Your Replit Project Locally**

If you haven't already:

1. Go to your Replit project.
2. Click the **3-dot menu** in the file explorer.
3. Choose **"Download as ZIP"**, then unzip it on your machine.

Or, if it’s linked to GitHub, you can clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### ✅ **3. Install Dependencies**

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the packages listed in `package.json`.

### ✅ **4. Set Up PostgreSQL Locally**

If your project uses PostgreSQL:

1. Start PostgreSQL on your local machine.
2. Create a database (if required):

   ```bash
   createdb your_db_name
   ```
3. Set environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` file or export them in your shell:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
   ```

(Use `dotenv` in your Node.js app if you're loading `.env` files.)

### ✅ **5. Run the App**

Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If your app is meant to be built and run in production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Your app will likely be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), based on the `localPort` config.

### ✅ Optional: Use VS Code for Easier Dev

1. Open the folder in **VS Code**.
2. Install the **ESLint**, **Prettier**, or any language-specific extensions.
3. Use integrated terminal to run commands.

Do you know what framework you're using (e.g., Next.js, Express, Nuxt)? I can give more specific instructions if needed.
