üìò AI Knowledge Workspace Platform: Full Development Plan
Unifying Knowledge Management with AI-Powered Insights

1. Product Overview
The AI Knowledge Workspace Platform is an innovative, AI-driven solution designed to transform how users interact with diverse content sources such as YouTube videos, PDFs, documents, and notes. By leveraging pluggable large language models (LLMs), the platform ingests multimedia content and generates valuable outputs like summaries, mind maps, searchable knowledge bases, and exportable files in formats like Markdown or PNG.  
Problem Solved:Users often struggle to extract, organize, and synthesize insights from fragmented sources, wasting time on manual processing. This platform addresses this by offering a unified, intelligent workspace with semantic search, visualization tools, and collaboration features.  
Unique Value Proposition:  

Flexible AI Models: Switch between local (e.g., Ollama) and cloud-based LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini).  
Context-Rich Answers: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with precise citations.  
Extensible Ecosystem: Export to tools like Notion or Obsidian and integrate via APIs.  
Team Collaboration: Real-time editing and sharing capabilities.


2. Key Personas & User Stories
üë©‚Äçüéì Students & Teachers

Need: Condense hours of lectures into actionable study materials.  
Example: A student uploads a 2-hour video and a 50-page PDF, receiving a 1-page summary and flashcards within minutes.  
Benefit: Saves time and improves retention with tools like offline access and auto-generated quizzes.

üë®‚Äçüî¨ Researchers & Analysts

Need: Compare and connect insights across multiple documents or videos.  
Example: A researcher uploads 10 papers, uses semantic search to find specific topics, and visualizes relationships via a knowledge graph.  
Benefit: Accelerates research by automating cross-referencing and insight extraction.

üë®‚Äçüíª Developers & Technical Users

Need: Integrate AI tools into custom workflows.  
Example: A developer connects the platform to a private LLM via API and triggers summaries via a CLI command.  
Benefit: Enhances flexibility with developer-friendly features like webhooks and model switching.

üßë‚Äçüíº Content Creators & Non-Tech Users

Need: Repurpose content easily for blogs or videos.  
Example: A creator clips a webpage via a browser extension and exports a video summary as YouTube chapter markers.  
Benefit: Simplifies content creation with intuitive, non-technical tools like voice input.
